#  Python Learning & Revision Notebook

This repository contains my **Python learning journey**, practice notebooks, and **structured revision material**.  
The goal is to build **strong fundamentals** while balancing Python revision alongside other projects.

---

##  Purpose of This Repo

-  Store Python learning notes in **Jupyter notebooks**
-  Revise core concepts in a **low-stress, consistent way**
-  Strengthen problem-solving mindset
-  Maintain a **single source of truth** for Python fundamentals

##  Future Additions

- [ ] Python problem sets
- [ ] CLI-based mini tools
- [ ] Performance comparisons
- [ ] Python internals & memory model
- [ ] Testing (pytest basics)

##  Notes

This repository supports **long-term learning**, not speed.  
Revision happens **weekly or fortnightly**, depending on workload.
